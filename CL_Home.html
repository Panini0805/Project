            <p class="home_text">This dataset was composed of the fortune 1000 companies, fortune's list of the top 1000 US companies by revenue, and for each company, data about them such as their industry, CEO, profits, revenues, and much more was provided. By analyzing this dataset, I hoped to gain insights into the way that businesses and their performance can be affected by specific factors. I wanted to find what factors make businesses thrive more than others, and drive them to further success. Because of that, I graphed and analyzed the way that variables such as company sector, employees, and more impacted their performance in areas such as profits and revenues. </p>

            <p class="home_text">The movie dataset was composed of over 9000 movies. It was extremely complete, displaying useful data, such as their release date, popularity, vote average, genre, and even a short description of the movie. Because of that, I was able to thuroughly analyze the dataset, take notice of which variables factor into the movie's success, and which take from it. By comparing how different variables interacted with each other, I was able to draw conclusions and insights from it.</p>
