        <p class="insights">The graph shows a positive linear correlation between the number of company employees compared to the revenues of that company. However, although there seems to be a clustering in the bottom-left cornering, with companies topping at $244B in revenues and 566k employees, Walmart overwhelmingly surpases these limits as an outlier with $500B in revenues and 2.3M employees. The high revenues are likely due to the size of the franchise, and the high employee count due to being hypermarkets needing large staffs to operate and to serve customers.</p>

        <p class="insights">When looking analyzing the graph specifics, the pattern where company sectors such as places providing people services have significantly larger employee counts than company sectors which provide different types of services such as business, or a product such as energy. This is because in order to scale company sectors based on places providing people services, more people need to be hired to provide them. On the other hand, economies of scales plays a bigger role in service providing sectors, such as BPOs (Business Porcess Outsourcing), where companies can grow disproportionally compared to employee counts.</p>

        <h3 class="d_insights">Insights:</h3>
        <p class="insights">This graph shows an interesting pattern, seeing as company sectors shown to have large employee headcounts also achieve the highest revenues. This is shown by sectors such as telecommunications and food and drug stores ranking in the top 4 for employee count and revenues. This can likely be attributed to the higher service costs given to customers in order to balance out higher company expenses. This is because these companies are able to charge more for their services because they have people providing them that have to be paid a living wage.</p>

        <h3 class="d_insights">Insights:</h3>
        <p class="insights">The past two graphs have shown that company sectors which center their business models around places providing services to others such as hotels, hospitals, and food and drug stores have the highest employee counts, and revenues, however, this graph shows that they also have the lowest profits. They have a large headcount because the model runs on people providing services to others, therefore needing a lot of employees. They also have large revenues because they can charge more for services since they have to pay the salaries of numerous employees. However, even if they can achieve higher revenues, the higher direct costs provided by the higher employee count still manage to significantly reduce the overall company profits.</p>
