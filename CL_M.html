        <p class="insights">The original language in which a movie was released has a great impact on it's overall popularity. This is shown by the fact that the average movie popularity by language varied over 68.3 points, depending solely on the language. On top of that, although not displayed in the graph, regardless of movies in ukranian being the most popular, with 76.085, only 2 have ever been produced, which raises the question why? On the other hand, the relationship between movie popularity, original language, and movies produced for english makes more sense. Seeing as it is the second most popular, with an average score of 51.6, and logically represents 79.8% of movies, making up 7446 of the 9335 in total.</p>

        <h3 class="d_insights">Insights:</h3>
        <p class="insights">There is an apparent and obvious spike in the popularity of 2024 movies, with popularity reaching an all-time high of 1,611.66 with the movie <i>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</i>. On top of that, movie popularity seems to be having an exponential growth over time, likely due to the exponential advances in technology, communication, and the facility of globalization.</p>

        <h3 class="d_insights">Insights:</h3>
        <p class="insights">As shown by the graph, there is not a very significant preference towards or agains any movie genre. Instead, they all seem to get similar rating on average. Nevertheless, the genre with the lowest vote average is horror with 6.18, and the one with the highest vote average is war with 7.12.</p>

    <button onClick="show_or_hide4()", class="dropdown">Effect of the Original Language on the Vote Average</button>
    <div>
        <iframe class="f1000_graphs" src="vote_avrg_lang.html"></iframe>
        <h3 class="d_insights">Insights:</h3>
        <p class="insights">Similarly to the effects of genre on the vote average, the original language that a movie was produced in also doesn't have a major impact on the movie's performance. This is because the range is only between 8 and 6.354, showing the lack of influence language has. Interestingly though, english, which most people would assume would be somewhere near the top due to it's larger fan base is actually third to last. This is likely because of the huge variety of movies, causing the poor ones to bring the average down regardless of the outstanding ones. On the other hand, the graph cannot be used to predict the performance of a movie using the original language, seeing as many of the top rated languages like bn, only have 1 movie produced which happened to be a hit. Overall, the language with the lowest average ratings is eu with 6.354, and the highest average is bn with 8.</p>
