        <p class="insights">The original language in which a movie was released has a great impact on it's overall popularity. This is shown by the fact that the average movie popularity by language varied over 68.3 points, depending solely on the language. On top of that, although not displayed in the graph, regardless of movies in ukranian being the most popular, with 76.085, only 2 have ever been produced, which raises the question why? On the other hand, the relationship between movie popularity, original language, and movies produced for english makes more sense. Seeing as it is the second most popular, with an average score of 51.6, and logically represents 79.8% of movies, making up 7446 of the 9335 in total.</p>
